	Data changed on first UCLK edge, captured on following edge, 
	clock inactive state low, msb first, 8 bit data
	Master mode, synchronous mode, 3-pin SPI 
	Uses ACLK
	Bit rate control = 02
	Port 3: SCLK, SI, and SO set to SPI mode, pin 3.0 as GPIO for CS/

PORTS:
	P1 controls LEDs and pushbutton. Most pins are NC, none are available for general use.

	*P2.0-3 reserved for analog signals (our app)
	*P2.4 is accelerometer interrupt
	P2.5 is NC
	P2.6-7 is for radio (GDO2 does not appear to be used)
	
	P3 is used for SPI and USB interfaces, P3.6 and P3.7 are NC. SPI CLK, SI, SO are sharable.
	P3.0 is radio CS/

	P4.0-2 are NC
	*P4.3 is accelometer CS/
	*P4.4-4.5 are available and have ADC inputs
	*P4.6 is available
	P4.7 is NC
