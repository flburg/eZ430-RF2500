STOCK SIMPLICITI DEMO CONFIGURATION

MCLK:	DCOCLK @ 8MHz (div by 1)			BSP_InitBoard()			
	DCOCTL = 0x7c	(DCOx = 3, MODx = 0x1c, MODx is a modulation for RFI mitigation apparently) 
SMCLK:	DCOCLK @ 8MHz (div by 1)			BSP_InitBoard()
ACLK:	VLOCLK						main.c

TIMER A:						main.c
	ACLK
	DIV 1
	Up mode
	About 1 second
	Interrupt enabled

SPI:
	Uses USCI_B0	
	Data captured on first UCLK edge, changed on following edge, 
	clock inactive state low, MSB first, 8 bit data
	Master mode, synchronous mode, 3-pin SPI (MSP430 context)
	Uses SMCLK/2 (UCxBRx set to 2) = 4MHz
	Bit rate control = 02
	Port 3: SCLK, SI, and SO set to SPI mode, pin 3.0 as GPIO for CS/
	5 KBps
	Interrupts disabled

PORTS:
	P1 controls LEDs and pushbutton. Most pins are NC, none are available for general use.

	*P2.0-3 reserved for analog signals (our app)
	*P2.4 is accelerometer interrupt
	P2.5 is NC
	P2.6-7 is for radio (GDO2 does not appear to be used)
	
	P3 is used for SPI and USB interfaces, P3.6 and P3.7 are NC. SPI CLK, SI, SO are sharable.
	P3.0 is radio CS/

	P4.0-2 are NC
	*P4.3 is accelometer CS/
	*P4.4-4.5 are available and have ADC inputs
	*P4.6 is available
	P4.7 is NC
