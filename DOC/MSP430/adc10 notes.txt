ADC config:
	ADC10CTL0
	ADC10CTL1

ADC10DF - data format (0: binary, 1: 2s complemenent)

INCHx - input channel

SREFx	- select reference	000 - Vcc/Vss

ADC10IE	- interrupt enable

ADC10IFG
	when DTC is not used, is set when conversion results are loaded into ADC10MEM
	when DTC is used, is set when a block transfer is complete
	is automatically reset when IRQ is serviced (can be reset by software)

ADC10ON	- core enabled

ADC10BUSY	- conversion in progress

ENC	- enable conversion (toggling aborts repeat or sequence conversions - see users guide section 22.2.6.6)

*ADC10CLK	- conversion/sampling clock
	ADC10SSELx	- select ADC10CLK source
	ADC10DIVx	- select ADC10CLK division

ADC10AEx	- disables port pin IO buffers

REFON	- enables internal reference
	REF2_5V	- selects 2.5/1.5v
	REFOUT	- if 1 puts ref v on Vref+
	REFBURST	- leave 0
	ADC10SR	- if sample rate < 50k, set this bit to reduce power
	do not use external reference

SHI	- conversion init
	SHSx - sample and hold source select
		ADC10SC bit (reset automatically)
		Timer_A outputs
	ISSH	- invert active SHI level
*	ADC10SHTx	- select sample period (4,8,16,32 ADC10CYCLES)
	SAMPCON	- indicates sync/sampling in progress
*	conversion takes 13 ADC10CLKs
*see users guide section 22.2.5.1 for pin model - determines delay needed
	input looks like series RC with R = 2k max and C = 27pf max
	tsample > (Rs + Ri) x ln(2^11) x C1
	tsample > (Rs + 2k) x 7.625 * 27pf

CONSEQx	- conversion mode select (single, sequence, repeat single, repeat sequence)
*	MSC	- multiple sample and convert - fast as possible conversion

*DTC	- data transfer controller (DMA) - uses MCLK
	ADCDTC1	- non-zero enables DTC
	do not transfer while ADC10 is busy (check ADC10BUSY bit?)
	one or two block transfer modes
	ADC10TB	- 0: one block, 1: two blocks
	ADC10DTC1	- # of 16 bit transfers in a block
	ADC10SA	- start address
	ADC10IFG	- set after complete block has been transferred; twice in two block mode
	sequence:
		write to ADC10DTC1
		write to ADC10SA
		a write to ADC10SA or write 0 to ADC10DTC1 cancels block; behavior slightly different depending on state
	ADC10CT	- continuous transfer
	ADC10B1	- 1: block one complete in two block mode
		  0: block two complete in two block mode 
		  (this and ADC10IFG can be polled for either block completion)
	ADC10FETCH - ????

	see users guide table 22-2 for timing details
