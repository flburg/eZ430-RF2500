DEFAULT - WSM

main_AP.c
	added adjustable time stamp period
	simplified code in sSelfMeasureSem a little
	added support for integer payload
	added space in payload for peeraddr
	changed SMPL_Receive to SMPL_RecieveWithAddr

main_ED.c
	added metrics for missed acks
	reorganized init, join, link, run, sSelfMeasure, sendWithAckReq into separate functions
	split sendPacket() into three functions: sendPacket() for dispatch, sendBestEffort() for no acks, sendWithAckReq() for acks
	removed createRandomAddress() and related code
	added hook into nwk to get local address (nwk_getMyAddr())
	cleaned up init code a bit
	added pressure (aux channel), seqno, and missedacks to binary packet
	removed support for text packet
	
nwk_api.c
	added SMPL_ReceiveWithAddr and modified SMPL_Recieve

nwk_api.h
	added SMPL_RecieveWithAddr prototype



WSM - ACCEL

main_AP.c
	added global SPI support
	disabled self measure packet to USB
	changed to fixed payload size in peerFrameSem (sizeof)

main_ED.c
	added global SPI support
	added support for accel alarm (accel.c, accel.h, accelInit(), soundAlarm() and Port2_ISR()
	
virtual_com_cmds.c
	modified transmitDataString() - probably deprecated, function not used in main.


virtual_com_cmds.h
	changed MESSAGE_LENGTH from 3 to 11 - see virtual_com_cmds.h



BSP

mrfi_board.c
	put #ifdef ACCESS_POINT around BSP_ISR_FUNCTION

mrfi_board_defs.h
	moved clk config, SPI pin configuration, read/write and SPI init macros to bsp_board_defs.h
	created reference macros to above for mrfi

bsp_board.c
	added bspSpiInit() function and call in BSP_InitBoard()
	bspSpiInit() calls the new macros in bsp_board_defs.h

bsp_board_defs.h
	added macros moved from mrfi_board_defs.h, and renamed



MRFI

mrfi_spi.c
	removed DUMMY_BYTE, READ_BIT, and BURST_BIT macros - they are now at the bsp level
	removed all code from mrfiSpiInit() because this is now done at the bsp level
	added MRFI_SPI_CLK_CONFIG() to mrfiSpiCmdStrobe() to make sure clock is correct for selected SPI device
